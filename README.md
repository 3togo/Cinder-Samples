Cinder-Samples
==============

Sample applications for the Cinder framework. In order to use these samples, clone this repository next to a clone of the Cinder Github repository like this:

[cinder_master]
* [blocks]
* [boost]
* [docs]
* ...

[cinder_samples]
* README.md
* [BouncingBalls]
* ...

### Cinder version 0.8.5 is required to use these samples.


These code samples are compatible with the Microsoft Visual C++ (Express) 10 compiler. XCode support for MacOS X is not included, because I do not own an Apple and would not be able to update the project files.

The C++ and GLSL source code, however, should run on all platforms without modifications. I assume you run the samples on recent hardware, supporting shader model 4. I have tested the samples on NVIDIA GPU's, it might be possible that ATI GPU's may produce shader compilation errors. If you find an inconsistency or platform related bug, please notify me or create a pull request, so that I can fix the issues and make these samples as cross-platform as possible. 

Find specific, sample related information in the sample's README.md files.

Thanks to all contributors and to the people behind the Cinder framework for doing an excellent job!
