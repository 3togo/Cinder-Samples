This text is rendered very efficiently using a special Signed Distance Field font file (SDFF) and can be scaled to any size without much loss in rendering quality.

Press [ or ] to change font size.
Press LEFT or RIGHT to change alignment.
Press UP or DOWN to change line spacing.
Press SPACE to swap colors.
Press F to toggle full screen.
Press V to toggle vertical sync.
Press W to toggle wire frames.
Press ESC to quit.

Tip: drag a single TXT file or another SDFF font file onto the TextRendering window to load and display it.

To create a new cross-platform SDFF font file:

1) Drag a font file (.TTF, .OTF) onto the SDFont.exe application, which you can find in "./assets/fonts"
2) The SDFont.exe will generate two files: a TXT and a PNG.
3) Run this sample and drag the PNG and TXT files (both together) onto the window.
4) Enjoy your new SDFF font file!
